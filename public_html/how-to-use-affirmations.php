	<li><h3>Live it! Feel it! Believe it!</h3></li>
	<p>The most important rule in using affirmations is that you have to literally live by them. You have to feel that they are true. If you can&#39;t believe what the affirmation says, it can cause exactly the opposite result.</p>
	<p>So the best is if you visualize them and "feel the meaning" while you are saying them and live as your choosen affirmations determines your life.</p>
	<p>e.g. if you want a bigger flat, imagine how good it is to live in that. Feel that you are happy to have enough space and feel that you deserve it. You are gonna like this feeling so much, that you&#39;ll literally feel the force that you have to act to reach it. Your subconscious will know that this is the aim and will do everything to achieve this.</p>
	<p>The main point is that the affirmations have to motivate your body and mind to take actions. If you don&#39;t believe in them, your mind will create the opposite result.</p>
	  <li><h3>Create your own favourite list on this site!</h3></li>
    <p>I grant you a possibility on myaffirmationlist.com, to pick your favourite images and make your own list. In case you click on the images, you&#39;ll see a favourite button. Click on that and (after logging in) our system will automatically put the image on your personal Favourites site. (You are able to see it only if you are logged in!)</p>
    <p>Creating your own favourite list makes it very easy to remember and use the affirmations. (And spares time as you don&#39;t have to search for your favourites every time amongst the others.) In addition it feels so good to look at the beautiful images and read those positive messages. I&#39;m already addicted. I hope this will help you a lot!</p>

  <li><h3>Read, think, say it out loud, write down!</h3></li>
	<p>You can read your affirmations, think about them, say it out loud or you can even write them down. Choose whichever suits you the most and do it repetitively every time you use them. (15-20X) The more you repeat them, the best result you will get.
	You can also mix the techniques. One day you say it out loud, on the other day write them down. My personal favourite is writing as it is much more slower and gives me time to immerse deeply in my affrimations. It is like a meditation.</p>
	<li><h3>Use your affirmations regularly</h3></li>
	<p>It&#39;s important that you use your affirmations at least once a day, but it is better to use them many times. 
	This way you strengthen the message to your subconscious-mind. I&#39;m not saying that one day left out destroys everything but negative thoughts on that days can erase the impact of the affirmations and you can start over the whole process.</p>
	<li><h3>Be persistent!</h3></li>
	<p>As with everything in life, persistence has a key importance here too. Affirmations don&#39;t work if you use them occasionally. I know it is hard. In the beginning everybody is very enthusiastic and that brings things forward, but if results don&#39;t come immediately, many people start to forget to read the affirmations or simply give it up. That&#39;s the stage you have to persist. If you are a little forgetful then set a reminder but please don&#39;t give up. You would lose a great chance to improve your life. Soon after this stage you are going to see results and you will be addicted to your new lifestyle.</p>
	<li><h3>Meditate on your affirmations!</h3></li>
	<p>Use your affirmations as a mantra for meditations, this helps to plant the message deeply in your subconscious-mind.</p>
	<li><h3>Mirror</h3></li>
	<p>Say your affirmations in front of the mirror. Look deeply in your own eyes. This helps to connect your subconscious-mind and to strengthen your self-consciousness and to love yourself more, to be in harmony with yourself.</p>
	<li><h3>Create your own affirmations!</h3></li>
	<p>In case you can&#39;t find  the affirmations that suit you the most, create your own! It is very easy. We granted a huge collection of affirmations for you, pick your favourites, collect ideas from them and create your own collection.</p>
	<h4>How to create your own affirmations?</h4>
      <ol>
		<li>Use only positive words!</li>
		<p>Do not use no, never or any negative words or sentences.</p>
		<p>e.g. instead of saying "I am not jealous." you should say "I trust my partner.". Try what you feel as you saying these sentences! The difference is huge, right? Some say that the subconscious doesn&#39;t take the "no" word into consideration and that&#39;s why the message of "I am not jealous." is that I really am.</p>
		<li>Use present tense!</li>
		The present tense makes your subconscious work immediately!
		<li>Always write about yourself!</li>
		<p>General things will not really help you. Affirmations have to contain information about you. eg.: Instead of "Everything is possible!" you should say "Everything is possible for me!".</p>
		<li>Do not mention the problem!</li>
		<li>Use short sentences but describe your desires in detail!</li>
		<li>Transform your favourite positive quotes to affirmations!</li>
		<p>This is my favourite thing! I really do like positive quotes. Why not turn them into an affirmation? They are so sophisticated and beautiful and it is joy to read them. Turning them into a message to our mind (an affirmation) creates our best tool.</p> 
      </ol>
