		<h3>Dear Guest!</h3>
    <p>First of all THANK YOU for visiting my site!</p>
    <p>I am a mummy on maternity leave, who has very good experiences with affirmations and want to share it with the world. I want to share it with YOU!</p>
    <p>First I met the phrase 'Positive Affirmation' in 2013, after my child was born. I had several issues back then with my compromised hormone system etc. I don't really want to bore you with the details. The essence is that I got a book about affirmations from a friend. I didn't really believe that it works but I gave it a chance. I thought the worse that could happen is that nothing happens but they can make no harm. BUT THEY WORKED and ARE STILL WORKING! I had a miracoulos recovery from my serious illnesses. However I still have a long way before me to be totally and perfectly healed but I believe my body is doing its job.</p>
    <p>After one visit at my doctors I decided to share these healing sentences with the world, so I started to learn how to make a website. I know I still have a lot to learn but I am trying to do my best and the result is this webpage. I hope it brings you as much joy as it brought to me!</p>
    <p>Have fun! Believe in yourself! Love yourself! Enjoy the beautiful images! Believe that you can change your world into a better one!<p>

        </li>
        <li>Share your favourite affirmations!
