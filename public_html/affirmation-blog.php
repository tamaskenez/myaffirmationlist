      I release all my anger. I do not have time to care about hatred, jealousy, envy, enemies. I spare my time for love. To love my child, to love my husband, to love my friends, to love my family, these are what really matters. <br />I live for the moment. I do not think about the past, do not fear the future. I have to do my best right now, right here. And I do it. I am doing everything to achieve my dreams. To have my dream job, to have my dream house, to stay healthy, to love and to be loved. <br />I have every tool in my hand to reach my goals, I just have to use them. And I use them. I use them well! <br />I take full responsibility for my life! I have full control. <br />And most of all...I am grateful for what I have already got!</p>

    <img src="smallpics/love24.jpg" alt="I am grateful for the love I get every day." title="Love Affirmation" class="img-responsive blog_image">
      <p>In Hungary we have a great tradition of complaining. Maybe it is because of our historical roots or the economical background, I don&#39;t know. One thing is for sure: I used to complain a lot.</br>

      I didn&#39;t like if the weather was cold, but I hated summer heat. I wanted a car, but when I finally got one (at the age of 32) I complained about driving and the fear I felt that I crash the car or myself.</br>
      I wanted a baby, but after my son was born I used to tell my friends how hard it is to take care of him.
      I complained about my job, love life, money, my parents, my overweight problems, actually everything.</br>
      But something was wrong with all this complaining thing. I thought, I should feel better after telling my problems to somebody. I should have been releived. But I wasn&#39;t. Instead of this relief I felt myself more miserable than ever.</br>
      One day one of my friends asked me why am I not satisfied with my life, what is this all complaining about. He said: &quot;You may not be rich, but you have roof above your head and you are obviously not starving. (Thanks for the honesty! :) -edior)  You have a cute, clever son and a husband who loves you. You have a job, you have friends. Aren&#39;t you grateful for all those things?&quot;</br>
      And that was the moment!</br>
      I realized how stupid I was. I had so many precious things in my life and I concentrated only on the bad ones.</br>
      From that day on, before falling asleep, I thank the Universe for all the good things I have in my life. I can assure everyone, this works for me like charm. I do not feel myself miserable anymore. I feel awesome!</br>
      It is not magic or an unexplainable thing. I simply love that feeling when I think about the good things in my life, and this can make huge improvement in one&#39;s life. Actually I love the feeling of gratefulness so much, that I started to practice it daytime as well. Believe me, it is awesome!</br>
      Now I like that I can experience snow, rain, warm and cold weather. I feel extremely lucky that I have my husband and my son in my life, their love means the world to me. I am grateful for the joy my friends bring into my life. I am happy that I am employed, even if it isn&#39;t my dream job. This creates me opportunity to learn something I love and gives me hope that one day my hobby will be my job. I believe that all is well in my life and every area is getting better and better every day!</br>
      I love my life so much!</br>
      Thanks for the Universe, thanks for God!</p></span><hr /> </div>
